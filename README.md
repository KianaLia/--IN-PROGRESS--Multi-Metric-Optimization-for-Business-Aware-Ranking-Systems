## 📝 Summary

This repository contains the preprint draft of our ongoing research on multi-metric optimization in ranking systems. Optimizing for a single metric often fails to capture the complexity of real-world business goals and user needs. By optimizing across multiple—sometimes competing—business metrics, our approach offers a more accurate modeling of the environment, leading to better recommendation and ranking outcomes for both users and businesses.

Our work introduces a **mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient algorithm** for **multi-objective optimization**. It supports:
- Arbitrary numbers of business and user-centric KPIs.
- Ability to incorporate explicit stakeholder-defined importance weights.
- Theoretical optimality using generalized eigenvalue problems and Rayleigh quotient formulation.
