## 📝 Summary

This repository contains the **preprint draft** of our ongoing research on **multi-metric optimization in ranking systems**. In today's complex business environments, recommendation systems must optimize not just for a single objective, but across multiple—often competing—business metrics like profit, user engagement, and conversion rate.

Our work introduces a **mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient algorithm** for **multi-objective ranking optimization**. It supports:
- Arbitrary numbers of business and user-centric KPIs.
- Explicit stakeholder-defined importance weights.
- Theoretical optimality using generalized eigenvalue problems and Rayleigh quotient formulation.

We demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms single-metric optimization approaches, offering more balanced performance across all key metrics.
